```markdown
### The Origin Story (150-200 words)
"After my 5th quarterly PI Planning session managing 200+ tickets across 5 squads 
in 12 different Excel files, I had a realization: we're all doing this wrong. 
Every PM I knew was suffering through the same manual nightmare. So I built 
the tool I wish I had."

- [ ] Record a 2-minute Loom walkthrough
- [ ] Show before (Excel) vs after (your tool)

Phase 2 (Q2 2026): Multi-team dependencies
Phase 3 (Q3 2026): Jira integration
Phase 4 (Q4 2026): Slack bot for updates

Long-term: Transform quarterly planning from 2-day workshops to 2-hour async sync."

### Business Model (if relevant)
"Exploring freemium model:
- Free: Up to 2 squads, 50 tickets

## Missing Elements for Top 1% Status

### 1. Deep Case Studies (CRITICAL)

**Current:** Bullet-point achievements  
**Need:** 3-4 deep-dive case studies (2,500-4,000 words each)

**Recommended Stories:**
1. **Pfizer GenAI Platform** (Your flagship - Strategic + AI/ML)

- Generic bullets don't differentiate you
- Stories demonstrate HOW you think
- Shows strategic PM, not just executor
- Failure stories show growth mindset

**Action:** Pick ONE and write it this week.

---

### 2. Thought Leadership Content

**Current:** None  
**Need:** 3-5 pieces of content demonstrating expertise

**Ideas Based on Your Experience:**

**Blog Post Ideas:**

**Action:** Write one 1,500-word article this month.

---

### 3. Visual Artifacts & Portfolio

**Current:** Text-heavy, minimal visuals  
**Need:** Rich visual storytelling

**Add These Visuals:**

**For GenAI Platform:**
- User flow diagrams (before/after)
- Platform architecture (simplified)
- Dashboards/metrics visualization
- Screenshots of the product
- User research synthesis
- Roadmap visual
- Sprint planning board

**For Smart Release Planner:**
- Screenshot tour (5-7 key screens)
- Before (Excel) vs After (your tool) comparison

- Architecture diagram
- Video walkthrough (2-3 min)

- Loom for video walkthroughs
- Flourish or Chart.js for data viz
- Canva for infographics

**Action:** Create 3-5 visual artifacts per case study.

---

### 4. Failure Stories & Learnings 

**Current:** All wins, no failures  
**Need:** At least 2 failure stories with learnings

**Psychological Trust:**
Elite PMs are vulnerable. They share:
- Experiments that failed
- Product pivots
- Wrong bets
- Stakeholder conflicts
- What they'd do differently

**Example from Your Experience:**

```markdown
### What Didn't Work: The Feature Nobody Used

**Context:**
Q2 2024 on Pfizer GenAI platform. Data science team pushed for 
advanced clustering feature. I green-lit it thinking researchers 
wanted AI-suggested groupings.

**What Happened:**
Built it in 6 weeks. Zero adoption after launch. Researchers 
never clicked the button. Engagement: <1%.

**Why It Failed:**
1. No user validation—trusted internal stakeholder over users
2. Too complex UX for cautious researcher personas
3. Didn't solve a top-3 pain point
4. "Cool tech" doesn't mean "needed feature"

**What I Learned:**
- Never skip user validation, even with tight timelines
- "No" to engineering is better than wasted sprints
- Researcher personas need proven, simple tools first
- Trust data, but validate with qualitative feedback
- 6-week bet gone wrong = 6 weeks of user value lost

**How I Changed:**
- Now require 5+ user interviews before any "innovation" feature
- Created "User Validation Checklist" for every initiative
- Paired every data science request with user research
- Built "feature sinking" tracker—reminds team of failed bets

**Impact of Change:**
Next 4 features: 85% adoption rate (vs 30% before)
```

**Action:** Write 2 failure stories (300-500 words each).

---

### 5. PM Philosophy & Operating Principles

**Current:** Implied through experience  
**Need:** Explicit, documented philosophy

**What Top PMs Share:**
- Product principles they live by
- Decision-making frameworks
- How they prioritize
- Leadership approach
- Values and non-negotiables

**Recommendation: Create "How I Work" Page**

```markdown
# How I Work
## My Product Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. User Truth > Internal Opinion**
"I never build without talking to 5+ users first. 
Every quarterly plan starts with user interviews."

**2. Ship Fast, Learn Faster**
"Perfect PRDs delay learning. I prototype in Figma 
and test in 2 days. Iterate based on real feedback."

**3. Metrics = Accountability**
"Every feature has a success metric defined before 
build. No vanity metrics—only business outcomes."

**4. Influence Through Alignment**
"PMs don't have authority—they earn trust. I document 
decisions, share rationale, and align before execution."

**5. AI is a Co-Pilot, Not Auto-Pilot**
"I use AI to accelerate—Claude for ideation, Copilot 
for prototyping—but product sense is still human."

---

### My Decision-Making Framework

When faced with competing priorities, I ask:
1. Does this ladder to company OKRs?
2. Will 20%+ of users need this in 6 months?
3. Can we validate the hypothesis in <2 weeks?
4. What's the cost of being wrong?
5. Does this create platform leverage?

If 3/5 are "yes," we build.

---

### How I Prioritize

**RICE Framework + User Research:**
- Reach: Active users affected
- Impact: 0-3 scale (L/M/H)
- Confidence: % from user validation
- Effort: Engineering weeks

But I override RICE when:
- Strategic bet for next 18 months
- Regulatory/security requirement
- Platform architecture debt

---

### My Weekly Rhythm

**Monday:**
- Quarterly progress review
- Stakeholder alignment (15-min syncs)
- Week planning with engineering

**Tuesday-Thursday:**
- User research (2-3 sessions)
- Sprint planning & standups
- Design reviews
- Prototyping/validation

**Friday:**
- Metrics review
- Retro + learnings doc
- Next week prep
- Deep work (strategy, writing)

---

### Tools I Can't Live Without

**Discovery:** UserInterviews, Dovetail
**Design:** Figma, FigJam
**Planning:** Jira, Confluence, Smart Release Planner
**Analytics:** Amplitude, Mixpanel, SQL
**AI:** Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT, v0.dev
**Communication:** Slack, Loom, Notion

---

### What I Value in Companies

- **Product-Led Culture:** PM has a voice
- **User Obsession:** Research budget exists
- **Shipping Velocity:** Bi-weekly releases norm
- **Cross-Functional Respect:** Engineering + PM + Design parity
- **AI-Forward:** Open to experimentation
- **Regulated? Bonus:** Love the complexity

---

### Red Flags I Avoid

- "PM writes specs for engineering"
- No user research budget
- Quarterly releases (too slow)
- "Product Marketing Manager" (confused role)
- Heavy waterfall process
- No metrics/analytics culture
```

**Action:** Create "How I Work" page (1,000-1,500 words).

---
