✅ **Specific** - Deep dives, not surface level  
✅ **Current** - Modern tech and trends  
✅ **Polished** - Professional quality  
✅ **Differentiated** - Unique angle or approach  

The key differentiator between good and great portfolios is **depth of thinking** - not just what you shipped, but why it mattered, what you learned, and how it demonstrates your product judgment.

Your portfolio is a product itself - apply PM thinking to it:
- Who is your user? (Recruiter, hiring manager, peer)
- What's the job to be done? (Evaluate your fit)
- What's your unique value prop?
- How do you measure success?
- How do you iterate?

Treat your portfolio as your most important product launch.
